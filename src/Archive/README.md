# Archive - Original ReactUI

This folder contains the original Mythic ReactUI components and themes.

These files have been archived as the main UI has been replaced by **Minerva** - a modern cyberpunk-styled interface.

## Contents

- `components/` - Original React components including:
  - `App.js` - Original main application component
  - `pages/` - Original page components
  - `MythicComponents/` - Reusable Mythic UI components
  - `utilities/` - Utility functions (Snackbar, Time, Clipboard, etc.)

- `themes/` - Original Material-UI theme configurations

## Note

Some utility functions from `components/utilities/` are still being used by Minerva:
- `Snackbar.js` - Toast notification system
- `Time.js` - Time formatting utilities
- `Clipboard.js` - Clipboard utilities

These may be migrated to Minerva in the future.
